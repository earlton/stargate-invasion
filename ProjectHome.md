A total conversion of SOASE that rewrites all aspects of the game to bring the varouis stargate franchises into the fold.

The mod will be built in 2 halves.  The first is the Pegasus side, I.E. Humans, Wraith and Asurans, with the Pirates being a classified race at the moment.  The second part of the mod, will add in the Asgard and Goa'uld races to the mix, we will even be creating a separate version of the mod as well, which will just be Humans, Asgard and Goa'uld, with the Lucien Alliance as the Pirates for that half.

This total conversion will be including the following:

1. Custom Models, everything from the ships and stations down to the nitty gritty details, Planets might or might not be effected, that has yet to be decided.

2. Added Planet types.

3. New Particle files.

4. Custom Abilities

5. New Loading Screens and custom Icons for everything.

6. New types of raids, from the Pirates to Travelers, to a rouge branch of the Wraith and Asurans.  Everything is possible.
